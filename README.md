# HW_3_2-MathQuestion
Problem 2: Write a method GenerateQuestion that can be used as a math tutor for a young student. The method should generate and display two random numbers that are to be added, such as:
  247
 +129
---------
The method should wait for the student to enter the answer. If the answer is correct, the method should return true, otherwise it should return false.
Then, in Main, generate three such questions. For each one, if the user answered correctly (if the method returned true) then display a "congratulations!" message. Otherwise display a message similar to: "you answered incorrectly, please try again!".
Hint 1: use Random, as seen in class!
Hint 2: see previous notes on how to format the output so it displays the numbers nicely aligned!
